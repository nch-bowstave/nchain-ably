This is a service used to sync and store blockchain headers which can then be used to validate transactions and merkle proofs forming part of an SPV pipeline.

By default, it uses [WhatsOnChain](www.whatsonchain.com) to sync headers using web sockets and stores the data in a local embedded sqlLite database making it highly portable.

## Quick Start

We produce docker images ready for you to use, to get started (within compose) take a look at the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file in the root of the repo.

Using docker is the quickest way to get started.

The only settings you need to be concerned with are:

      - DB_DSN=file:/data/blockheaders.db?_foreign_keys=true&pooled=true;
      - DB_SCHEMA_PATH=/migrations

DSN can be used to change the local database location - this should be a volume mount into the container while SQLite is the only db option, we will support more in future.

DB_SCHEMA_PATH should always be set to /migrations, that's the location within the container where the db migration files are head and will setup the database correctly.

## Endpoints

Currently, we support an HTTP Rest transport, the endpoints are:

### GET http://{{host}}:8442/api/v1/headers/height

Returns the current cached block height as well as the current live network block height.

```json
{
  "height": 696617,
  "networkHeight": 696617,
  "synced": true
}
```

### GET http://{{host}}:8442/api/v1/headers/:blockhash

Returns block information when provided with a blockhash.

```json
{
  "hash": "0000000007e95100bbaf9c467b1416c91ee6c8942d78db630d8d7c4c49eaa717",
